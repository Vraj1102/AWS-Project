This project demonstrates how to build a fault-tolerant, highly available web server cluster using **NGINX**, **Keepalived**, and **AWS EC2** instances. The setup ensures zero downtime by dynamically assigning a **Virtual IP (VIP)** and failing over between servers using **VRRP protocol**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **NGINX** – Web Server
- **Keepalived** – VIP failover via VRRP
- **AWS EC2** – Ubuntu 22.04 Instances
- **VRRP Protocol (112)** – Heartbeat for HA
- **Bash / Linux Networking** – Configuration and testing

---

## 🎯 Objectives

✅ Ensure continuous availability of web services  
✅ Automatically fail over traffic to backup instance on failure  
✅ Learn practical HA setup using Keepalived and NGINX  
✅ Configure AWS infrastructure securely

## ⚙️ Infrastructure Overview

- **2 EC2 instances** (Instance A and B) in the same VPC and Subnet
- **Floating Private IP (VIP)**: `192.162.1.100`
- **Security Group Rules**:
  - Port 80 (HTTP)
  - Port 22 (SSH)
  - Protocol 112 (VRRP)
  - ICMP (optional)

## 🧩 Steps to Deploy

### 1. 🖥 Create AWS Environment

- Create a **VPC** with CIDR `192.162.0.0/16`
- Create a **subnet**: `192.162.1.0/24`
- Launch 2 EC2 instances in the same subnet using Ubuntu 22.04
- Allocate a **secondary private IP** (VIP): `192.162.1.100` (do not attach to any instance)

### 2. 🔐 Set Up Security Group

Allow the following inbound rules:

| Type        | Protocol/Port | Source           |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| HTTP        | TCP 80         | 0.0.0.0/0        |
| SSH         | TCP 22         | Your IP          |
| Custom Prot | Protocol 112   | 192.162.1.0/24   |
| ICMP        | All ICMP       | 0.0.0.0/0        |

### 3. ⚙️ Install NGINX & Keepalived

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nginx keepalived net-tools


Update web page:

echo "Welcome to Instance A" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html

4. 📦 Configure Keepalived
Instance A – MASTER:

sudo nano /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf

conf 

vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state MASTER
    interface eth0
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority 101
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass devops123
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.162.1.100
    }
}

Restart service:

sudo systemctl restart keepalived

🔁 Test Failover

    Check VIP from any node:

ip a | grep 192.162.1.100

    Simulate failure:

sudo systemctl stop keepalived

    The VIP should move to the BACKUP instance.

    Access the virtual IP in browser or with curl:

curl http://192.162.1.100
